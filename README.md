# Supplementary files and code

This branch contains supplementary files and code of the study [Machine learning prediction of prime editing efficiency across diverse chromatin contexts](https://rdcu.be/dLu0f) and the initial preprint [Predicting prime editing efficiency across diverse edit types and chromatin contexts with machine learning](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.09.561414v1).

Note, that you can find supplementary files for both, ePRIDICT and PRIDICT2.0 models in this branch.

If you are interested in running ePRIDICT locally, visit [https://github.com/Schwank-Lab/epridict](https://github.com/Schwank-Lab/epridict).
For running PRIDICT2.0 locally, visit [https://github.com/uzh-dqbm-cmi/PRIDICT2](https://github.com/uzh-dqbm-cmi/PRIDICT2).

An online implementation of both, sequence-context based prime editing prediction (PRIDICT2.0) and epigenetic/chromatin-context based prime editnig prediction (ePRIDICT) can be accessed via [https://pridict.it](https://pridict.it).
